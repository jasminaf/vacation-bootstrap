        <h1>Summer Vacation</h1>
        <p>This year's vacation was the best vacation ever; I've been in the far east and I went to the most beautiful country, there I found the meaning of ultimate freedom and relaxation.</p>

            <h2>Trip to China</h2>
            <p>My journey started during the month of July , I flew to Hong-Kong to visit my father. I traveled there for a week, It wasn't my first trip to this fabulous country - I've been there few times before. We took a ferry from Hong Kong to a chinese city called Shenzen near the border, I was lucky enough to have my father with me to show me around.
             Shenzen is a small town not far from Hong-Kong and we spent the day wandering through markets, taking in the sights, and generally just relaxing, and then we took a ferry back to HK, I remained in HK for a few days and flew back to Israel.</p>

         <h2>Going home</h2>
          <p>When I came back to Israel I was overwhelmed by the economic, military and social problems that developed while I was away. mostly by the new law suggested by judge Tal, it felt like my whole world was collapsing on me so I decided to run away from all the mayhem, pollution, terror to a quiet place , a place that I can lie down between the sand â€“ Greece. I flew to the island of Kos.
           It was the most amazing week of my life. the wonderful experience included beautiful beaches, incredible parties and meeting interesting people.
           To conclude, this vacation was the best i've ever had, possibly due to the fact this was the last school vacation of my life. I will always cherish every little moment of it.</p>
